 What This Will Do
Trigger on push to main or manual run.

Build your Python package into dist/:

.whl file

.tar.gz source archive

Uploads the dist/ directory as an artifact so you can download it.

ðŸ§ª To Run This Workflow
Push your code to GitHub (main branch), or

Go to Actions tab â†’ "Build Python Package" â†’ Run Workflow

ðŸ“¥ To Download Built Package
Go to Actions â†’ build run â†’ Artifacts

Click python-package-dist

Download and extract it â€” youâ€™ll get .whl and .tar.gz

âœ… Next Steps (Optional)
Want to automatically publish to PyPI? (I can help you add a twine step)

Want to build only when you push a tag like v0.1.0?

Want to include test & linting steps too?
