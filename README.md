 What This Will Do
Trigger on push to main or manual run.

Build your Python package into dist/:

.whl file

.tar.gz source archive

Uploads the dist/ directory as an artifact so you can download it.

🧪 To Run This Workflow
Push your code to GitHub (main branch), or

Go to Actions tab → "Build Python Package" → Run Workflow

📥 To Download Built Package
Go to Actions → build run → Artifacts

Click python-package-dist

Download and extract it — you’ll get .whl and .tar.gz

✅ Next Steps (Optional)
Want to automatically publish to PyPI? (I can help you add a twine step)

Want to build only when you push a tag like v0.1.0?

Want to include test & linting steps too?

1)Want to automatically publish to PyPI? (I can help you add a twine step)


What You’ll Need
✅ 1. A PyPI account
If you don’t have one, create it.

✅ 2. A PyPI API token
Go to https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/

Create a new token (choose "Entire account" or limit it to a project)

Copy it (you won’t see it again)

✅ 3. Add Token to GitHub Secrets
In your GitHub repo:

Go to Settings > Secrets > Actions

Add a new secret:

Name: PYPI_API_TOKEN

Value: (paste your token)

📄 Updated Workflow: Build + Publish to PyPI
This workflow does everything:

Build the Python package

Upload it as an artifact

Publish to PyPI when you push a version tag like v1.0.0


 How to Trigger This Workflow
Make sure your version in pyproject.toml is updated, e.g., 1.0.0

Commit and push your changes to main

Then tag and push the tag:

bash
Copy
Edit
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
🎉 This will trigger the workflow and publish your package to PyPI.

✅ Best Practices
🔐 Keep your PYPI_API_TOKEN secret!

🧪 Test with TestPyPI first by changing:

bash
Copy
Edit
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
and using a different secret (e.g., TEST_PYPI_TOKEN)

📝 Always update your version number when tagging (PyPI doesn’t allow overwrites)
